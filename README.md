# Three.js Realistic Forest Example

## How to Use

1. Download a realistic `.glb` or `.gltf` tree model (e.g. from [Polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/models?c=trees) or [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/search?features=downloadable&q=tree&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models)).
2. Place it in `public/models/tree.glb`.
3. Copy the `index.html` and `main.js` files into your project.
4. Serve the directory using a local server (e.g. VS Code Live Server, `python -m http.server`, or similar).
5. Open in your browser to see a realistic forest!

## Requirements

- three.js (install via npm or use CDN)
- A tree model (`tree.glb`)

## Notes

- For best results, use a low- to mid-poly tree model.
- You can add more tree types or scatter rocks, grass, etc. for extra realism.
